# Assessment-Test 
Task to make a one page wedsite with given images to make it look as close as possible.

[Click here](https://jacobwebster.github.io/Assessment-Test/) to see it in action.

## What I used
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) my text editor of choice
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for easy push-to-deploy hosting
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for less time-consuming and more modular CSS
- [Command Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) for compiling the Sass into CSS
- [Vanilla JS](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp) to create the checkbox app
